We have started by Friday noon by 2PM from Chennai a 1000 KM journey. We are going to a place called 

Gokarna a small beach town in Karnataka India. As I was travelling towards it, I was wondering what I’m 

going to do in gokarna a whole day in a place where full of beach. Because beach is what meant to be 

Early morning or evenings pass time for me. Ok let’s just get to the ground for real we are still in bus to 

Bangalore my friend gave me a heart attack that we are not going to reach on time Bangalore. We were 

Supposed to go main bus stand of Bangalore by 9.30 PM and we are getting down at 8 PM we getting down 

at some place exactly 10 KM out from our destination, that too Friday night in Bangalore traffic I thought our 

Second trip is ended before even see the light. I believe neither God nor luck. But fortunately we have 

Reached to the bus GoKarana bus on time, had nothing for dinner. We started our night journey in the bus 

By morning 8.00 AM we have reached the bus stand. We took an auto and reached the beach. I’m still not 

Convinced with the fact that I’m going for a beach. As we step down from mountain clip through steps I 

Start hearing the sound of waves and wind mixed together. That leaves me speechless, I felt that is enough 

For the trip It was 8.30 in the morning most peaceful and pristine place with nature’s sound. I could still feel it

Whenever I say it. We walked half a kilometer stretch of OM beach it was most relaxing and every step I 

Make the lighter I feel . As compared to other places (City), the temp here was little moderate 29*C, you 

Could spend a whole day and the breeze also eases your presence out there in the beach. One interest 

Thing about gokarana is not only beach also trek you need to take little trek on the hills to every other beach 

and there are other ways but I would prefer to take the trek. We went on the hills reached the other side

the left side of OM beach ,the Kudle beach . The wait is over I jumped into the beach and couldn’t get out

of it . Sometimes traveling makes the moment surreal I spoke with a guy came from Burma he doesn’t speak

English and I don’t speak Burma still had a discussion over 15 mins and knowing a lot of fact about him. 

After spending more than 3 hrs in water. My friend insisted me that we should cover other places as well

.Its like series of beach starting from the  Gokarna town beach  till half-moon  beach at least till that only we 

Have gone .Now its time to half moon beach.</p>
